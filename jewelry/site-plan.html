      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My proposal is to create a website about the basics of making your own jewelry. It would include information
         on materials and tools (prices, where to get them, their uses, etc.) as well as some easy tutorials.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience would be people who want to learn a new hobby, but are unsure on where to start.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Making your own jewelry can seem intimidating at first. My mission is to help introduce more people to my 
        personal craft of choice and overcome some of the confusion and uncertainty that comes with learning a new hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years ago, craft stores such as Joann’s and Michaels used to host in-person classes for their community to 
        learn new crafts and techniques. Nowadays, craft stores don’t host these classes, and we are left to scour 
        the internet for instruction. 
        Of course, there are many other tutorials you can follow to learn how to make jewelry with many other techniques,
        but I figure I should share my knowledge and experience as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to share information on the best places to buy supplies, what supplies to get, 
        the best brands, and show readers like you how to get started. Soon, you’ll be wearing bracelets, necklaces, 
        and earrings that you’ve created yourself- and you’ll have the joy of knowing that you made it. 
        If you are ready to begin your new hobby, simply click on the button labeled “Tools & Materials”.
