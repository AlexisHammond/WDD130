      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My proposal is to create a website about the basics of making your own jewelry. It would include information
         on materials and tools (prices, where to get them, their uses, etc.) as well as some easy tutorials.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience would be people who want to learn a new hobby, but are unsure on where to start.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Making your own jewelry can seem intimidating at first. My mission is to help introduce more people to my 
        personal craft of choice and overcome some of the confusion and uncertainty that comes with learning a new hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years ago, craft stores such as Joann’s and Michaels used to host in-person classes for their community to 
        learn new crafts and techniques. Nowadays, craft stores don’t host these classes, and we are left to scour 
        the internet for instruction. 
        Of course, there are many other tutorials you can follow to learn how to make jewelry with many other techniques,
        but I figure I should share my knowledge and experience as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to share information on the best places to buy supplies, what supplies to get, 
        the best brands, and show readers like you how to get started. Soon, you’ll be wearing bracelets, necklaces, 
        and earrings that you’ve created yourself- and you’ll have the joy of knowing that you made it. 
        If you are ready to begin your new hobby, simply click on the button labeled “Tools & Materials”.

      </ul>
      <h3>Tools and Materials</h3>
      <h4>Tools</h4>
      <p>
        <br>Needle-nose pliers: These pliers are usually used to grip your project while working and don’t do so well with shaping wire. 
        <br>Round-nose pliers: These are good for shaping wire, but not for gripping your project.
        <br>Wire cutters: Just as the name suggests- they are for cutting wire. While there are many places that sell wire cutters for jewelry-making, what I really recommend are wire cutters meant for floral crafts. They usually take less effort than the ones for jewelry-making and give cleaner cuts.
        <br>Some stores will also offer a 3-in-one tool. While they are a little cheaper than buying the set of 3, I don’t recommend them. Although, if you’re in a pinch, they’ll do.
      </p>
      <h4>Materials</h4>
      <p>
        <br>Chain: often sold in spools at your local craft stores
        <br>Wire: Also sold in spools at your local craft store. For jewelry-making, a gauge around 18-24 are recommended. When choosing your wire, keep in mind that the lower the gauge, the harder it will be to shape- but it will last longer and be more durable.
        <br>Beads: Beads come in all shapes, colors, and sizes. You can choose whatever you’d like for these, but make sure they will fit on whatever wire or string you use!
        <br>Jump Rings: small rings made from wire. They are used for many different purposes like connecting elements and holding charms.
        <br>Lobster Clasps: Meant for Bracelets and Necklaces, if you’ve worn necklaces before these will look very familiar to you.
        <br>Fishhooks: Earring hooks meant for dangle-earrings 
        <br>Head pins and Eye pins: Both are used with beads. Head pins have a stopper on one side meant to stop beads from falling off. Eye pins are similar, but have a loop instead of a stopper so that the segment can be attached on both sides.

      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s get started with a simple pair of earrings:
      </p>
      <h4>Materials/tools needed</h4>
      <p>
        2 head pins or eye pins
        <br>2 earring fishhooks
        <br>2 of your favorite beads
        <br>Round nose pliers (or a 3 in 1 tool in my case)
        <br>Wire cutters
      </p>
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>
        Step 1: take one of the eye pins/ head pins and insert it into the hole on one of your beads. If you find that the hole in your bead is too large to stay on, consider adding a smaller bead to act as a buffer.
        <br>Step 2: use the round nose pliers (or round part of the 3 in 1 tool) to create a loop in the wire opposite the eye/head of your pin. Don’t close the loop.
        <br>Step 3: cut the excess wire with your wire cutters (or the wire-cutting segment of your 3 in 1 tool).
        <br>Step 4: hook the open loop of your eye/head pin onto the earring fishhook.
        <br>Step 5: close the loop on your pin so it won’t fall off.
        <br>Step 6: repeat steps 1-5 to complete the second earring
        <br>Voila! Your first piece!
