                        <br>them. Although, if you're in a 
                        <br>pinch, they'll do.

                        <br>They usually take less effort than 
                        <br>the ones for jewelry-making and 
                        <br>give cleaner cuts.

                                Also sold in spools at your local craft store. For jewelry-making, a gauge around 18–24 is recommended.
                                When choosing your wire, keep in mind that the lower the gauge, the harder it will be to shape — but it will last longer and be more durable.

                        <h3>Head Pin and Eye Pins</h3>
                        <p>
                            Both are used with beads. Head pins have a
                            <br>stopper on one side meant to stop beads from 
                            <br>falling off. Eye pins are similar, but have a loop
                            <br>instead of a stopper so that the segment can 
                            <br>be attached on both sides. I do not recommend
                            <br>buying these online as it is hard to determine
                            <br>the quality you will be receiving.

                    Tip: When choosing beads and other materials, make sure they are compatible.
                    <br>All too many times I have chosen wire too thick for the beads I got or the hole in 
                    <br>my bead was too large for my head-pin and falls off.
