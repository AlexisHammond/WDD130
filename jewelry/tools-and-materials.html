                        <br>little cheaper than buying the
                        <br>set of 3, I don't recommend
                        <br>them. Although, if you're in a 
                        <br>pinch, they'll do.

                    <h3>Wire Cutters</h3>
                    <p>Just as the name suggests- they 
                        <br>are for cutting wire. While there 
                        <br>are many places that sell wire 
                        <br>cutters for jewelry-making, what I 
                        <br>really recommend are wire 
                        <br>cutters meant for floral crafts. 
                        <br>They usually take less effort than 
                        <br>the ones for jewelry-making and 
                        <br>give cleaner cuts.

                    <h3>Head Pin and Eye Pins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Both are used with beads. Head pins have a
                        <br>stopper on one side meant to stop beads from 
                        <br>falling off. Eye pins are similar, but have a loop
                        <br>instead of a stopper so that the segment can 
                        <br>be attached on both sides. I do not recommend
                        <br>buying these online as it is hard to determine
                        <br>the quality you will be receiving.

                    Tip: When choosing beads and other materials, make sure they are compatible.
                    <br>All too many times I have chosen wire too thick for the beads I got or the hole in 
                    <br>my bead was too large for my head-pin and falls off.
