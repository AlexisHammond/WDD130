                    Making your own jewelry can seem intimidating
                    <br>at first. My mission is to help introduce more 
                    <br>people to my personal craft of choice and 
                    <br>overcome some of the confusion and uncertainty 
                    <br>that comeswith learning a new hobby.

                    Years ago, craft stores such as Joann’s and Michaels
                    <br>used to host in-person classes for their community to 
                    <br>learn new crafts and techniques. Nowadays, craft
                    <br>stores don’t host these classes, and we are left to 
                    <br>scour the internet for instruction. Of course, there are 
                    <br>many other tutorials you can follow to learn how to 
                    <br>make jewelry with many other techniques, but I figure 
                    <br>I should share my knowledge and experience as well.

                    The purpose of this website is to share information 
                    <br>on the best places to buy supplies, what supplies to 
                    <br>get, the best brands, and show readers like you how 
                    <br>to get started. Soon, you’ll be wearing bracelets, 
                    <br>necklaces, and earrings that you’ve created yourself- 
                    <br>and you’ll have the joy of knowing that you made it. If 
                    <br>you are ready to begin your new hobby, simply click 
                    <br>on the button labeled “Tools & Materials”.
